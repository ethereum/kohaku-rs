//! Client for interacting with Tornadocash relayers.
//!
//! Tornadocash relayers are services run by third parties that accept and submit withdrawal
//! proofs on behalf of users. They allow users to withdraw from Tornadocash to a fresh
//! address that has no ETH to pay for gas at the cost of a small fee. Relayers are run by
//! independent parties, and the Tornadocash DAO does not endorse any particular relayers.
//!
//! See [tornado-relayer](https://github.com/tornado-dao/tornado-relayer/tree/mainnet-v5) for
//! the reference implementation.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```no_run
//! # use alloy::{
//! #     primitives::{Address, U256},
//! #     providers::{DynProvider, Provider},
//! # };
//! # use kohaku_tornadocash::{
